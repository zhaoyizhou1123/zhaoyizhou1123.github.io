I am a junior student of Yao Class at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). 
I have a broad interest in _theoretical_ foundations of machine learning.

I have been working on reinceforcement learning theory, such as multi-agent
RL and offline RL. Besides, I also look forward to participating in other research fields of machine learning, including but not limited to deep learning (theory), optimization, game theory and control. 

# Research Experience
- Feb 2023 - now: student intern, supervised by Prof. [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) at University of Washington. We aim to design brand new offline RL algorithms with theoretical guarantees inspired by the decision transformer. 
- Feb 2022 - Feb 2023: remote research, supervised by Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) at Caltech. We introduced a class of networked Markov potential games, designed a localized actor-critic algorithm and derived the first finite-sample bound for multi-agent competitive games that is independent of the number of agents. See our preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04865).

# Skills
