I am a senior student of Yao Class at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). 
My goal is to develop machine learning algorithms that combine rigorous theoretical foundations with real-world practicality. Currently, I focus on both theoretical and empirical questions in reinforcement learning. In addition, I have a wide interest in fields related to machine learning, including but not limited to game theory, robotics, large language models, deep learning, optimization and control.

# Selected Research
<!-- - June 2023 - now: Optimization, supervised by Prof. [Jingzhao Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/jingzhao/home). We hope to extend parameter-free optimization in stochastic gradient setting. -->
## Model-based return-conditioned supervised learning
Research intern at UW (Feb. 2023 - Aug. 2023).

Supervisor: [Simon S. Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/).

We proposed model-based return-conditioned supervised learning (**MBRCSL**), a novel offline RL framework that is able to do trajectory stitching while retaining the strength of return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) to avoid Bellman completeness requirements. [[website]](mbrcsl_website/)

<!-- - Feb 2023 - now: Offline RL, supervised by Prof. [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) at University of Washington. We aim to discover advantages of decision transformer (DT) over classical offline RL algorithms from theoretical perspective, and improve DT to cope with issue of trajectory stitching.  -->

## Networked Markov Potential Games 
Remote research intern at Caltech (Feb. 2022 - Feb. 2023).

Supervisor: [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/).

We proposed networked Markov potential games (NMPG) as a more practical relaxation of Markov potential games (MPG), and designed a localized actor-critic algorithm with provable finite-sample bound. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04865)

<!-- - Feb 2022 - Feb 2023: Networked MARL, supervised (remotely) by Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) at Caltech. We introduced a class of networked Markov potential games, designed a localized actor-critic algorithm and derived the first finite-sample bound for multi-agent competitive games that is independent of the number of agents. See our paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04865). -->
