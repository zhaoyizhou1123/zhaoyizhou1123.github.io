\begin{section}{Research Experience}
    % \begin{subsection}{IIIS, Tsinghua University}{Sep 2023 - Present}{Advised by Jingzhao Zhang}
    %     \item Investigated parameter-free convex optimizations
    % \end{subsection}

    \begin{subsection3}{CSE, University of Washington}{Feb 2023 - Present}{Advised by Simon Shaolei Du}
        \item Proposed theoretical explanations of decision transformer
        \item Discovered settings where decision transformer outperforms classical offline RL algorithms
    \end{subsection3}

    \begin{subsection3}{CMS, Caltech (Remote)}{Feb 2022 - Feb 2023}{Advised by Adam Wierman}
        \item Introduced a class of networked Markov potential games
        \item Designed a localized actor-critic algorithm
        \item Derived the \emph{first} finite-sample bound for multi-agent competitive games 
        that is independent of the number of agents
    \end{subsection3}
    

    
    % \begin{subsection}{Lazy Corporation}{Intern of Indolence}{Summer 2018}{NYC, New York}
    %     \item Assisted senior procrastinators in avoiding tasks
    %     \item Developed new ways to postpone meetings and ignore emails
